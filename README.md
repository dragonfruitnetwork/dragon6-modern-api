### Overview

This is a work-in-progress extension of the Dragon6 API that allows the "modern" stats to be consumed by clients.

Modern stats are defined as the ones now available on the official Rainbow Six Stats Site, run by Ubisoft.
Stats are collected per-match and stored using a rolling 120-day window, that can be expanded to any timeframe within the original window.
